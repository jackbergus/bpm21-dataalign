\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we presented an approach tackling conformance checking for log traces over Data-Aware Declare Models. The proposed approach exploits an efficient Automated Planner such as PDDL for aligning the log traces to the Data-Aware Declare model via a preliminary partitioning of the data space. \texttt{\color{red}[TODO: experiment outcome]}.

Future works will investigate the relationships between planners and approximate path matching techniques \cite{Myers1989}, thus allowing to return not only the optimal alignment but also suboptimal ones, that might be of interest for the user. Also, we might investigate the possibility of reducing this problem to a top-$k$ query answering scenario \cite{Ciaccia}. We will study the expressiveness of the automata-based alignment technique under the same working assumptions, thus studying whether the current approach can be directly extended to correlation conditions. If not, we will further investigate the possibility of performing alignments over data-aware knowledge bases \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-39696-5_18}, which potentially quicken the time required to test the satisfiability of the data conditions by conveniently indexing (i.e., pre-ordering) the payload space \cite{IdreosGNMMK12}. In such scenarios, model alignments will be equivalently re-written as either queries or as plans in PDDL.
